# Which territories have the most beneficiaries mentioned in the Panama Papers? #

## Introduction ##

The Panama Papers refer to a massive leak of confidential documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca in April 2016. The leaked documents revealed information about thousands of offshore companies and their owners. These documents exposed the widespread use of offshore tax havens and shell companies by politicians, celebrities, business leaders, and other influential figures to hide assets, evade taxes, and engage in illegal or unethical activities. 

With these visualizations, I wanted to see which countries/territories had the most beneficiaries (which in the dataset are called 'officers') to get a better idea of where people requiring these services are from.

## Data used: ##
* Data set containing the Panama and Paradise Papers as well as other offshore leaks.
  * [source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/paradisepanamapapers "Panama and Paradise Papers") 
  * The data was obtained as csv files from Kaggle
