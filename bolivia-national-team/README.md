# Home winrate of the Bolivian national association football team compared to other CONMEBOL teams #

## Introduction ##
Bolivia, in the context of international association football, is notorious in South America for its enormous home advantage thanks to its altitude, as many of its cities are located in very elevated terrain. As a result, many teams that face Bolivia in away games struggle because of the lower levels of oxygen present at those heights. Even the best teams in the world, such as Brazil and Argentina, struggle in those conditions, with Brazilian superstar Neymar Jr. describing these matches in Bolivia as 'inhumane'.

I wanted to see how big this aforementioned advantage is by looking at the results of home matches played by Bolivia during the last 30 years and comparing them to the current FIFA rankings. In order to do that, I have decided to compare Bolivia's home win rate and its FIFA rankings relative to the other teams in South America's association football confederation (also known as CONMEBOL).
